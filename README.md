#No Feed

No Feed hides the Facebook News Feed.

##Install

You can get No Feed on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ajhlinhaimmakhbabjcgmhchbpehgkog).

##Todo

- If anyone knows how to get the No Feed icon to show up properly in chrome://chrome/extensions, I'd really appreciate it.
- It would be nice if the extension never showed the News Feed rather than hiding it after it's been shown.
